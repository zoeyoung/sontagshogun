										Looped Alphabet
								</div>

										August 15th, 2014 
								</div>
								<div class="p2"> 
										Hey everyone, we're really excited to announce Sontag Shogun's first score, composed for Neza Momiski's "Looped Alphabet". Here's what Neza has to say about the project:
								</div>
								<div class="pquote">
										"Looped Alphabet is an absurdist drama, depicting an enclosed pseudo world, exploring the idea of continuous presence in the flow of information. The story unravels in Sharing space where communication devices are staged as architectural elements of the fictional interior.
								</div>
								<div class="pquote">
										The main character endeavors to reveal the Alphabet, which would restore conduct in the Sharing space and bring it back to it's roots, when he finds himself involved deeper and deeper in a hypnotic circle of gossip, schemes, subjective interpretations and power games. The path towards the truth seems lost, until he encounters an unexpected confrontation with himself."

									<div class="p4">
										Sontag Shogun’s immense debut full-length album, “Tale”, compiles three years worth of composing and directed textural improvising, molded into nine concise musical statements. They have been experimenting with songform and traversing nostalgic emotional territories, quietly honing their craft alongside collaborators across disciplines such as video, film, dance, performance and poetry. Primarily making use of a grand piano, field recordings, tapeloops and digitally treated vocals, the trio has discovered a unique niche that straddles identifiable genre boundaries. Repetitions of phrases, digitally glitched-out melodies, superimposing practice takes with studio takes. Call this album modern classical, ambient, new age, Sontag prefers their own nomenclature: lullanoise. 
									</div>
									<div class="p4">
										“Tale” was recorded whilst the three members were living in separate cities (Jesse in Busan and Seoul, Jeremy in London and Ian in Brooklyn); the resulting composite is both by design and by circumstance, a pastiche of aural geography, culture, and the subjective experiences accumulated on their respective sabbaticals. “Tale” engages the listener from start to finish (or as the titles suggest, from “tale” to “tail”), performing a pseudo-seance reviving the dead memories and reanimating, if only for just a moment, the instances that inspired and informed the music they have created. We can hear sound documents from a trek through a Columbian jungle, a piano tuner testing the ivory at the Southbank Centre and a South Korean traditional singer hitting a buk. These wordless vignettes bring to mind the retelling of a story, perhaps best experienced between the bindings of an as-yet written collection.
									</div>
									<div class="p4">
										All in all, "Tale" is a study in nostalgia: a rumination on our relationship to the past and how traces of memory haunt and shape us with every breath.

												<div class="p4">
												"A brilliant use of nostalgically damaged soundscapes to breathe life into a sad but fairly anonymous bit of chamber loveliness, a la Caretaker...The ideas and execution throughout this EP are superb" (Norman Records).
												</div>
												<div class="p4">
												"They show their quality to present warm, cinematographic soundtracks, with spoken word (in Dutch even, always nice), field recordings, and electronics, with that electric piano never far away. Quite delicate music, which makes their music probably more suited for wild life documentaries or sad stories about loss and redemption" (Frans De Waard).
												</div>
												<div class="p4">
												This EP centers around the A-side’s “Let The Flies In”, which is Sontag Shogun’s single culled from their forthcoming LP, Tale. LTFI is supported by a reworked studio version of the previously released “Paper Canes” (off Absent Warrior, Abandoned Battlefield, 2012), featuring intricately designed sonic textures and cut-ups of choral voice and acoustic guitar as well as the usual SS fare of processed field recordings. “Hungarian Wheat”, by now a SS repertoire mainstay, is presented in an alternatively ambient version, drenched in reverb and what seems like a flooded corridor of static and breath samples.
												</div>
												<div class="p4">
												Finally, the album culminates with “Gekheid Op Een Stokje” (Dutch, meaning “all jokes aside..” or literally “madness on a stick”), a fragmented collage-piece that symbolically wraps up the last year of SS’s life from Jesse’s point of view. SS spent the year in three separate countries, going through piano recordings and emailing each other tracks to flesh out the rest of the compositions on Tale bit by bit. The samples used here were recorded by Jesse and Lauren Walker (his partner in Absent Warrior) while on tour in April with Foxout!, and just as the title suggests, this track represents a sort of half-joking homage to both this displaced method of working, and the globetrotting that Sontag’s members have recently individually pursued. All in all, the LFTI EP certainly serves as an appetizer for the full-length record to come, but can equally stand on its own as a self-contained musical statement delivered by this emerging new-music trio.

										This live performance (released in full) marked the return of Sontag Shogun's piano trio format, after a long period of experimentation with both improvisation and the use of signal-filtration systems. For most of this era, SS had been developing site-specific collages of both audio and video feeds from stacked TVs, doubly-filtered through Jesse's laptop and Jeremy's electronics, blanketed by a confusing grid of live piano loops. SS also spent time improvising with artists as diverse as Tom Carter, Matana Roberts and Aki Onda. Absent Warrior, Abandoned Battlefield presents the trio's natural ability to craft linear song-structures, making use of reel-to-reel tapes, treated vocals, oscillators and contact mic'd brushes alongside the usual piano + electronix. These five lush, shapeshifting pieces paint lonely and desolate landscapes of wind-swept grass, galloping seas and glacial permafrost, slowly building, slowly taking away.

								<div class="h4">Sontag Shogun (2006-on)
								</div>
								<div class="p4">
								Sontag Shogun was borne from the ashes of the fiery phoenix. This blazing winged creature produced a wet mewling pup, crawling blindly through the slick muck that was wet, ashy birth.
								</div>
								<div class="p4">
								Sontag Shogun is, put simply, an ongoing experiment. Somewhere between a lullaby and a dirge, Sontag Shogun takes their lullanoise and tries to find the strange, eery moments that exist within beauty. The snapshot before and after a bright, wide smile. The warm gleam of bones on the beach, picked clean of meat and tendons. 
								</div>
								<div class="p4">
								Sontag Shogun is an ambient, electronic piano trio comprised of former members from [the] slowest runner [in all the world]. Pooling their influences from modern classical, improvised and ambient musical spheres, they create longform shape-shifting compositions that are at times lush and melodic as well as textural and unpredictable. They have improvised with artists as diverse as Matana Roberts, Tom Carter, Aki Onda as well as a collective of Japanese contemporary video artists. Sontag Shogun performs alongside black and white video-loop collages from films and archival footage, embracing the evocative and emotive nature of their melodic textures. They make music to dream away to, or from.
								</div>
								<div class="p4">
								“There’s a tangible loneliness to Sontag Shogun's music, but there's a wistful loveliness present, too. The Brooklyn trio assumes a sort of songwriting assembly line, with Ian Temple's emotive, tremulous piano figures falling prey to Jesse Perlstein's legion of atmospheric, laptop-catalogue samples and the oscillator/tapes/electronic militia at Jeremy Young's command. Borne thereof are instrumentals that hover somewhere between quiet-storm raucous and New Age quiescent: giggly ivory-tickles brush elbows with industrial found sounds; funny-bone effects trill like cicadas or fireworks or distant slide whistles; sonatas and pitch-shifted drones suck face. Unlikely antecedents turn up in this mournful and meditative melee (The band counts composers like Arvo Part, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Philip Glass, and Max Richter among their influences.) Perhaps it's just that they seem to, for succumbing to a Sontag Shogun song is like wandering into a mist or thinny in a mystery novel: the first few seconds are universally objective, but beyond that, the experience is colored by what the listener brings to the table.”    
								</br>

								Even more simply put, Sontag Shogun is:
								</br>
								Jeremy Young, Jesse Perlstein, and Ian Temple
